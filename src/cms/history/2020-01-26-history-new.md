      Immanuel Nobel pioneered the development of underwater mines, designed
      some of the first steam engines to power Russian ships, installed the
      first central heating systems in Russian homes and was

      the first to develop modern plywood, cut with a rotary lathe.

      One of his sons, Ludvig Nobel, was the founder of the machine-building
      factory Ludvig Nobel, a great armaments concern and the inventor of the
      Nobel wheel. Ludvig was also the founder of BraNobel, the foremost Russian
      oil industry in its time, and launched the world’s first diesel-driven
      tugs, tankers and u-boats, besides building the first European oil
      pipeline in Baku. Alfred Nobel, a prolific inventor who acquired 355
      patents during his lifespan, was the creator of dynamite and the blasting
      cap from which he made a substantial fortune of which he left the bulk to
      form the Nobel Prizes.

    The foundation, created to manage the estate of Alfred Nobel and to
    implement the conditions of his testament. The Nobel Family’s Social
    Commitment Under the leadership of Ludvig Nobel, and later on by his oldest
    son Emmanuel, the BraNobel Nafta company in Azerbaijan grew into the world’s
    second largest in its field. The diesel engine factory in St. Petersburg
    became the largest in the world. At this time the Nobel industries in Russia
    were the country’s greatest and most influential business organisation with
    more than 50.000 employees.

    The success of Ludvig was based on a humanitarian and innovative way of
    doing things, combined with the mind of a scientific entrepreneur. The
    world’s first oil transportation ship and pipelines for oil were constructed
    for the oil fields of Nobel in Baku. As a visionary leader Ludvig strived to
    improve the conditions for the workers at the Nobel industrial sites. 


    This was achieved by the introduction of shorter working hours, adequate
    housing, schools and healthcare and recreational facilities. He also opened
    a cooperative bank for the employees and the world’s first profit sharing
    system for the workers called “Nobelites”. Sustainability and social
    commitment was the trademark of the Nobel industries.

    It was formed by the descendants of Immanuel Nobel the younger, i.e. the
    father of Alfred, Ludvig, Robert and Emil Nobel. The first three of the
    aforementioned brothers were engaged from 1873 in establishing, financing
    and operating the BraNobel oil company in Baku, the largest company in
    Russia and the second largest oil company in the world. The Nobel family is
    also represented at the Nobel Prizes Award Ceremonies which are held in
    Stockholm on the 10th of December every year since 1901. In 2007, the Nobel
    family archives, kept in the town archives of Lund, were inscribed in
    UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register.
