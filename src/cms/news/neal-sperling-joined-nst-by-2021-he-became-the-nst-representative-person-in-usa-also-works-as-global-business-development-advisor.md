Neal Sperling

NST representative in USA

Neal Sperling is the founder and CEO of a global strategic advisory service that has advised startups to very high net worth individuals. He has been referred to as a "World Class Problem Solver" and "World Class Connector" by 5-time New York Times international best-selling author Robert G. Allen.

For over 20 years, Neal has devoted himself to studying how to replicate the problem-solving approaches used by history's most innovative, successful thinkers – from DaVinci, Edison, Einstein, Tesla, Buckminster Fuller, Steven Jobs to Elon Musk.

Neal has since been privileged to go on to connect with the world's most recognized academic leaders, entrepreneurs, millionaires, billionaires, heads of state, military leaders, and Nobel Prize winners.

Today, he provides individuals and organizations with a wide range of accelerated business development, promotional, marketing, licensing, and distribution strategies and solutions to vastly improve their abilities to penetrate and dominate new markets through the unique “systems thinking” approaches he himself has developed and become increasingly noted for.

Neal has increasingly been invited to speak on stages and podcasts around the world to share and amplify on his unique insights and proven approaches to accelerate meaningful social impact. His aim is to now help anyone to think more efficiently, effectively, consistently, and successfully, achieve rapid clarity, and through it, to ultimately realize their highest goals by learning to look at any future business, professional, or personal challenge faced through the above "expanded eyes of genius."
