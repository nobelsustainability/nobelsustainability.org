  Mungo Park added, “We are creating a multi-sovereign backed Global Green
  Investment Bank and other nations are waiting to participate as soon as the
  corporate structure is in place.”\ Mr Park explained that the investment bank
  “will provide a service to technology companies and specifically, will not
  compete with the investment community”.\ “Quite the opposite,” he assured. “In
  fact, its model will be to help companies become investor-ready, bridge
  financing at a fair and reasonable margin above the investment bank’s cost of
  money, and will enable companies to strengthen their boards, their management
  teams, their documentation and their intellectual property portfolios.”


  Chairman of the Nobel Sustainability Trust, Professor Michael Nobel,
  commented, “The official recognition of the award and the Nobel Sustainability
  Trust foundation expressed during this CleanEquity Monaco conference is of
  outmost importance, both to the organisation and myself. The tremendous value
  of such a recognition being confirmed by a world-renown expert in the field
  like HSH Prince Albert in a plenary session of a meeting of this type cannot
  be underestimated.”
