    the members of the Nobel family and founders of NST have, with great
    concern, been observing the devastation of the world’s vital, natural and
    non-renewable resources. This over-consumption has led to an increase in
    global temperatures and pollution of land, food, water and air. The founders
    believe that the economic and social health of civilisation will, to a large
    extent, depend on the availability of renewable energy and a sustainable
    approach provided in agriculture, forestry, industrial manufacturing and
    water reclamation. This will require substantial intellectual and financial
    efforts. It is the aim of NST to assist with this process.


    The mission of the Nobel Sustainability Trust is therefore to promote a
    sustainable economic growth that preserves and ultimately enhances the
    living systems on the planet, create opportunities for people and harness
    human ingenuity in support for a prosperous common future.


    By participating in and supporting the Trust, its programs and activities,
    we encourage people to take a stand for our future as a species on a
    life-sustaining planet.

    It is our position that nothing is more important than this and we want to
    sustain human life on this planet, through efforts in the following areas:




    1. Reduction of climate change with emphasis on global warming through the
    promotion of advances in sustainable production and consumption with
    emphasis on non-polluting and renewable technologies.


    2. Acceleration in the transition to sustainable societies through promotion
    of initiatives that increase prosperity, improve governance and enhance
    transparency.


    3. Within the limits of the planet’s carrying capacity, pursuing the
    creation of a pollution-free, life-sustaining environment for all.




    In pursuit of these goals, NST is instituting a Sustainability Conference
    including bestowing two




    Sustainability Awards in technology and implementation as well as two
    scholarships in the same field.




    The purpose of the Nobel Sustainability Trust Awards is to recognise
    individuals for their outstanding contribution to sustainability and a
    commitment to ensuring that the need of the present is met without
    compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

    We will establish an international conference with focus on alternative,
    renewable, sustainable energy and ways of combating pollution and global
    warming.




    Participants will be invited from major suppliers and consumers of such
    energy as well as scientists, corporate leaders, politicians and
    legislators.




    The objective is to look into the future and to present hands-on solutions
    for global sustainability. Top keynote speakers will be engaged accompanied
    by panel debates and workshops.




    The conference is planned to be held annually or bi-annually and will
    circulate around the world.
