  The Awards will be given to scientists or institutions who have made important
  discoveries of potential importance to the wellbeing of mankind.
sectionOne:
  column1: >-
    The Nobel Sustainability Trust Awards will be issued in the following two
    categories:




    1. Leadership in Innovation. The SustainabilityAwardfor Innovation will
    recognise individuals or organisations who have made important discoveries
    in support of sustainable technologies, in their production
    and/orconsumption, and who have demonstrated the ability to convert these
    discoveries into solutions that are implementable and can be produced on a
    commercial scale using sustainablemethods.


    2. Leadership in Implementation. The Sustainability Award for Implementation
    will recognise leadership as characterised by a deliberate approach to
    accelerating the global adoption of sustainability and recognising
    individuals or organisations that make an outstanding contribution to
    implementing sustainable solutions and who demonstrate a commitment to
    ensuring that the needs of the presentare
    metwithoutcompromisingtheabilityofthefuture generations to meet their own
    needs.
  column2: >-
    Where in both cases, sustainability criteria include specifically usage of
    natural resources and ecosystem services consistent with planetary
    boundaries or the development and usage of methods of alternative
    non-natural resources complementing the scarce natural resources of our
    planet and resulting in positive social and economic contribution to society
    and a positive impact on governance and transparency.

    NST will bestow two educational scholarships to support and inspire young
    people to contribute to the development of sustainability innovations.
sectionThree:

    The function of a country representative is to act, within the country’s
    jurisdiction, as an ambassador for NST. NST Representatives will seek
    financial support for the creation of its Sustainability Award and funding
    for conference and events management infrastructure associated with the
    award. This will be achieved through, donations and licensing of the NST
    name and services.
  column2: >-
    Country representatives, professionally managed and in accordance with
    financial regulations, will assist with:


    * Contacting potential sources such as sovereign funds, corporations, family
    offices and professional associations, to assess whether they would accept
    to sponsor NST’s activities. All interested parties will be subject to a
    strict due diligence and evaluation procedure.

    * Obtaining and maintaining a collaborative agreement with the foremost
    technological universities in the representative’s region or country and to
    ascertain that these academic institutions form and maintain a local
    committee to propose to the lead university or its committee, the invention,
    discovery or technical development which potentially could be of
    demonstrable benefit to the general population in sustainable technology.

    * Assessing the interest in the representative’s home country or its major
    cities in hosting a sustainability conference followed by a Gala Dinner
    including the Award Ceremony.

sectionFour:
  heading: The Award Coordinating Entity's Role
  text: >-
    Award Coordinating Entity (ACE) will, in consultation with NST, select and
    manage the list of universities in the NST network for the technology
    awards.




    The ACE will form a Sustainability Award Committee that reflects the
    requisite competence for the Sustainability Award in Technology. This
    Sustainability Award Committee will have the final say in the selection of
    the award winners in this category. (see next chapter)




    It will be the ACE’s work to analys the presentations and create a
    short-list of five candidates, from which the Awards Selection Committee
    will select the Award winner. The person responsible for implementing the
    process of implementation will also receive a similar award. The ACE possess
    the evaluative capacity and network of experts to ensure its competence and
    ability of selecting appropriate award winners. The aims and objectives of
    NST, as well as anticipating media reactions, should all be taken into
    consideration in this context.
sectionFive:
  column1: >-
    The local academic institutions will be selected from an internationally
    recognised ranking list by the ACE in consultation with NST. The
    Sustainability Award Committee will consist of members of the various
    faculties it is this committee which will select the suitable candidates for
    the awards on an annual basis. Many universities have created sustainability
    units already, these would be prime candidates for membership of the
    network.




    The members of the committees should meet regularly during a scholastic year
    to identify and evaluate discoveries and developments of sustainable
    technologies. The candidate selections by the local university must be
    submitted to the ACE before the end of each scholastic year.
  column2: >-
    Information about the inventions, discoveries and proposals should be
    collected primarily from the same region as each respective university.
    Improvements on information availability, through social and other media,
    will enable and facilitate collection and transmission of information on new
    developments and technologies, globally.




    Each of these university committees will propose a maximum of three
    candidates and the nominations must follow objective and consistent
    criteria. The implementation of the discovery which will also be rewarded,
    must offer a clear benefit to a majority of its potential users and be
    reasonable in development and commercial manufacturing costs. It should
    offer the possibility to be produced and distributed on an affordable and
    unrestricted scale. The candidates’ work could be patented or copyrighted at
    the time of submission and could also be in the process of being
    manufactured on a limited scale.

    It is to be expected that most of these institutions already possesses a
    department or centre of sustainability or in any case an informal structure
    devoted to this subject whose members could form the nucleus of such a
    committee. The Award Coordinating University’s Role One of the great
    challenges for the ACU will be the process of managing the number of
    candidates put forward by the university network. Multiple names are likely
    to be submitted.




    It will be the ACU’s job to analyse all the presentations and create a
    short-list of 5 candidates, from which the Awards Selection Committee will
    select the Award winner. IBM’s preliminary selection process will be hugely
    helpful in developing theshort-list but the ACU will be required to possess
    the evaluative capacity and network of experts to ensure its competence and
    ability of selecting appropriate award winners. The aims and objectives of
    NST, as well as anticipating media reaction, must all be taken into
    consideration.




    The Awards Selection Committee will always have final say and a strict
    procees will be observed to ensure that the NST Awards will be recognised as
    being entirely independent of the Nobel Prizes. Location of the Award
    Coordinating University.The general public and scientific community are not
    generally aware of existing awards and there is no globally recognized award
    in the field of sustainability.




    The foremost academic institutions on the 2018 Times Higher Education
    Ranking, showed that 21 of the top universitiesare UK or US based, all of
    these institutions have demonstrated an interest in sustainability. It is
    logical, therefore, that the ACU should also be based in one of these two
    countries. There is a preference, currently for a university in the UK,
    given it proximity to NST and the uncertainty surrounding the United States
    commitment to the Paris Climate Accord. The Award can in this way, retain a
    European flavor.




    The ACU will be allowed to nominate its own candidates. It is, however, the
    principal purpose of the Award Selection Committee, to select the winner and
    the four runners up, from the shortlist which IBM’s artificial intelligence
    program will have compiled from the bulk of the candidates submitted by the
    universities in the network.
sectionSeven:

    The selected institution responsible for producing the short-list, will
    benefit from substantial academic prestige as the final arbiter of
    sustainable technology development around the world. The project’s
    administrative costs will be relatively modest once it is established so
    long as the project evaluation process is adhered to. NST will, if necessary
    support the ACU financially but it expects all ACU candidates to submit
    proposals, which include a financial model, which sets out estimated costs
    in sufficient detail for NST to ascertain if financial support is required.
  column2: >-
    The annual budget for administration, legal work and salaries for the main
    office in Zürich and the representative offices in Stockholm and Costa Rica
    has been calculated at around €900,000. This amount includes some
    compensation for the Award Selection Committee as well as a contribution to
    some direct administrative costs of the nominating universities.




    Determining a precise budget for the various projects involved in the annual
    award events will depend on the availability of existing facilities and
    resources. Such a project will require substantial funding but the budget
    for each activity will be related to its ambition level. The costs and
    arrangements of a conference in time and complexity will be substantial but
    dependent on the number of participants as well as the budget for the
    following prize events. The total operating budget for all annual activities
    including the Conference and the Award Event has been estimated at
    €2,000,000.
